# chat-box
In this project I have created a real-time chat application using React for Front-end and NodeJS for the backend. I have used Socket.io for real time chatting and communicating between the client side and the server side. Used custom CSS for styling. The link for the application is- https://5f48c596a1413d57173b54f3--chat-box-ap.netlify.app/
